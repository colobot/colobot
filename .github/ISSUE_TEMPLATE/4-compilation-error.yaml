      Please describe the exact steps you took to:
      1. Obtain the source code (include commit id if you used git or download url if you did not)
      2. Install dependencies
      3. Configure the build by using cmake
      4. Compile the game
      The more detailed your description is the higher the chance that we may be able to reproduce the error

      Please post:
      1. The complete console output of cmake (if possible)
      2. The complete console output of the compilation step (if possible)
      Including the full output rather than just the final error message increases the chances that we will have the context necessary to understand the error
