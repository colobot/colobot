\b;Programs dispatched by Houston
According to the data transmitted by the satellite, our engineers have developed two programs. The first one guides the \l;shielder bot\u object\botshld; through the narrow valley north close to the place where the key has been located. You can follow it without fearing any attack:
\c;
\s;extern void object::Outward()
\s;{
\s;	\l;shield\u cbot\shield;(1,15);   // activate the shield
\s;	\l;goto\u cbot\goto;(6,160);    // go close to the key
\s;	\l;shield\u cbot\shield;(0,15);   // deactivate the shield
\s;}
\n;
The second program guides the \l;shielder bot\u object\botshld; back to the \l;spaceship\u object\base;:
\c;
\s;extern void object::Return()
\s;{
\s;	\l;shield\u cbot\shield;(1,15);   // activate the shield
\s;	\l;goto\u cbot\goto;(8,60);     // go to the spaceship
\s;	\l;shield\u cbot\shield;(0,15);   // deactivate the shield
\s;}
