\b;From Mission Control
Build a \l;radar\u object\radar; on the highest point in the area. Make sure that the radar will work safely even after your departure to other planets. Your \l;research center\u object\research; should be able to provide a solution.

It is possible that the organisms detected are in fact the \l;worms\u object\worm; alluded to by the first expedition. If this is indeed the case, don't be excessively alarmed: they seem fairly harmless to living organisms but could cause the programs of bots and buildings to malfunction through the emission of viruses.

Radars not only give you precious information about objects and organisms present in the region, they also relay information to and from the Earth once you have taken off to other planets. It is highly probable that problems with the radar stations built by the first expedition caused the transmission problems that we are aware of.

In order to help you with the boring task of gathering the necessary raw material, we have developed a program that instructs the \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr; to look for \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; on its own (see the programming page \button 53;).

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
