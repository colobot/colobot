\b;A Word on New Policies
We are sorry to have to bring this to your attention but this seems like a good a time to let you in on a little concern we're having at the moment. There has been a strong reaction in the public opinion and in Congress concerning your systematic termination of the "indigenous inhabitants" of the planets you've been visiting. Congress has chosen to demonstrate its sensitivity to the concerns of the general population.

We hereby relay their new directives and these directives intimate for you to limit the casualties as much as humanly possible. In other words, do your very best to spare the life-forms you encounter from now on. Your mission should of course in no way find itself jeopardized by this new course of action.

\b;From Mission Control
Your energy resources appear dangerously limited at this time and so is your arsenal but you need to locate and retrieve the previous expedition's \l;black box\u object\bbox; so you can proceed to the next planet.

We received a piece of information from your predecessors, via the observation satellite, regarding a new type of weaponry they have developed precisely for a predicament such as this one.

This weapon will offer you an opportunity to demonstrate your newfound compassion towards \l;indigenous species\u object\ant; for it is not a weapon of mass destruction. What it offers instead, to the best of our knowledge, is an option to incapacitate them, rendering them, if only temporarily, harmless. If this is indeed the case, you'll need to act quickly before they are given a chance to become hostile to you again.

\b;Procedure
Perform the \l;research program\u object\research; and experiment for yourself but don't forget to bring this new weapon back on board. We are very curious to study its workings.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
