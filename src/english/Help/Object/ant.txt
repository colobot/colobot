\b;Ant
\image ant 8 8;
Ants shoot tiny corrosive balls that eventually gnaw into the protective shielding of bots and buildings, causing them to explode.

\l;You\u object\human; can resist their attack much longer than most buildings and bots, and your protective shield will be restored as your wounds heal. However, if you stay too long in their range or if there are too many of them, your life is in great danger.
