\b;\button 146; Thumper
\image bottump 8 8;
Tracked bot designed to hit the ground with enormous force. The purpose of the thumping is to turn \l;ants\u object\ant; and \l;spiders\u object\spider; belly up within a radius of 100 meters. An insect on its back is not dead but will struggle to get right side up again. After approximately 60 seconds of effort, it will usually succeed.

To visualize the zone of impact, hit the <range> button \button 41;. Little red dots outline the circular zone for 20 seconds.

The bot uses up a large amount of power. A thump will drain 2/5ths of a \l;regular power cell\u object\power;.
