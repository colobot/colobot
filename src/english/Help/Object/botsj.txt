\b;\button 142; Winged Sniffer
\image botsj 8 8;
Jet propelled flying bot equipped to prospect the geological structure of the subsoil. Whenever it locates something of use, the sniffer lays down the following marks:

- a \l;red cross\u object\stonspot;       -> \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore;.
- a \l;yellow circle\u object\uranspot;  -> \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore;.
- a \l;green cross\u object\enerspot;   -> energy deposit, useful for a \l;power station\u object\station; or a \l;power plant\u object\energy;.

The display at the bottom of your screen indicates the temperature of the reactor. Keep an eye on it. If the reactor overheats, the engine stops and the bot crashes.

Winged bots can fly across natural obstacles such as mountains or lakes but their energy supply uses up quickly. They're slow on the ground. To cover a short distance that will not call for flying, it is recommended to use a \l;wheeled sniffer\u object\botsr; instead.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;jet\u cbot\jet;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the sniffing arm, use \c;\l;sniff\u cbot\sniff;\n;.
