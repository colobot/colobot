\b;Worm
\image worm 8 8;
Worms transmit viruses to programmed bots. The virus alters the programming to such an extent that the bot either functions in a very erratic way or stops functioning altogether.

Worms live in the subsoil but sometimes emerge and crawl on the surface. When they are underground they are undetectable and indestructible.
