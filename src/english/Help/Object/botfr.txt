\b;\button 143; Wheeled Shooter
\image botfr 8 8;
Wheeled bot equipped with a fireball cannon.

The fireball cannon is an efficient weapon against most kinds of \l;enemies\u object\mother;. Use it sparingly though for it requires large amounts of energy. A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; will only allow you to shoot 4 fireball bursts.

Tip : it is possible to move the mouse while shooting, so as to sweep a larger area.

Wheels constitute a standard, fast and energy-saving mode of propulsion, which is perfectly adapted for a relatively flat terrain. Whenever the terrain gets sloped, it is advised to use a \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj; instead, or, if this is impossible, a \l;tracked shooter\u object\botfc;.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the fireball cannon, use \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;. To raise or lower the aim, use \c;\l;aim\u cbot\aim;\n;.
