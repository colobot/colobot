\b;\button 151; Legged Shooter
\image botfs 8 8;
Ant-legged creeping bot equipped with a fireball cannon.

The fireball cannon is an efficient weapon against most kinds of \l;enemies\u object\mother;. Use it sparingly though for it requires large amounts of energy. A \l;regular power cell\u object\power; will only allow you to shoot 4 fireball bursts.

Tip : it is possible to move the mouse while shooting, so as to sweep a larger area.

A moving legged shooter uses up half as much energy as a \l;wheeled shooter\u object\botfr;. A legged bot is also perfectly adapted to climb the steepest slopes.

\t;Programming
To program the bot's movements, use the following commands : \c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n;, \c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n;, \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;, \c;\l;goto\u cbot\goto;\n;.

To program the fireball cannon, use \c;\l;fire\u cbot\fire;\n;. To raise or lower the aim, use \c;\l;aim\u cbot\aim;\n;.
