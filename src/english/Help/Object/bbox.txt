A black box is actually orange so as to be easier to identify and locate. Each \l;spaceship\u object\base; is equipped with a black box that records and stores information about the flight.

A black box can also be used to leave important information. On every planet the first expedition has left a black box containing the coordinates of the planet it was heading towards next.
