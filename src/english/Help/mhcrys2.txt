We relayed a transmission to your \l;bot factory\u object\factory;. It concerns a bot designed to detect raw materials in the subsoil: energy sources, ore. We call it a \l;sniffer\u object\botsr; for short. Preliminary analysis leads us to believe that the presence of titanium ore on Crystalium is closely linked to the growth of large blue crystals. If this is indeed the case, this information should allow you to save some precious time. A \l;derrick\u object\derrick; is of course required for the extraction.
