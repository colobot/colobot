5) Eliminate all \l;ants\u object\ant;. Note that you should recharge and repair the shooter regularly. Check your levels.

6) Fully charge the \l;grabber\u object\botgr;'s power cell, then radio-control it to the summit...
      a) Access the first level by ramp on west;
      b) On first level travel east to find second ramp;
      c) On second level travel south to find third ramp;
