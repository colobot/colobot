\b;From Mission Control
With the help of the fourth \l;key\u object\key; (D) located nearby, you will finally gain access to the \l;vault\u object\safe;. The groundbreaking bot you'll find inside was named a "\l;phazer\u object\botphaz;".

A program allowing for a collaboration between a \l;phazer\u object\botphaz; and a \l;shielder\u object\botshld; has been attached.

You should soon find yourself in a position to test your new weapon. Your last mission is to dispose of the \l;Alien Queen\u object\mother;, the egglayer responsible for the growing number of insects on Terranova. The phazer might very well be the only bot capable of getting the job done.

There will then be no further obstacle to the human colonization of this magnificent planet and you'll soon be able to notify Earth of the success of your mission.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
