\b;Walkthrough
It is safer for \l;you\u object\human; to stay on the \l;spaceship\u object\base;. You may get hit a few times but not fatally.

Put your new \l;winged orga shooter\u object\botoj; to good use and don't waste any time. First shoot the ants on your right, then turn clockwise around the spaceship, flying at low altitude.

If you can not do it this way, place the \l;winged orga shooter\u object\botoj; on a safe place north of the spaceship, then save yourself. You can then take your time to shoot the ants one after another; they can do no harm to the spaceship and the black box.
