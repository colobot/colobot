\b;Walkthrough
You should build a \l;radar\u object\radar; first.

The \l;ants\u object\ant; appear to be running away from you. Try to circle around each one of them until they find themselves trapped between you and a \l;mine\u object\mine;. They'll opt for the mine and blow themselves up.

Then bring the \l;black box\u object\bbox; aboard your ship. It is next to the derelict spaceship.
