\b;Exercise
Instruct the bot to find all the \l;blue crosses\u object\waypoint; on the ground, but do not get too close to the \l;mines\u object\mine;. When the bot passes over a cross, it disappears. Here is the general principle:

	Repeat forever:
	o  Look for a mine
	o  If a mine has been found, calculate the opposite direction
	o  Look for a cross
	o  If nothing has been found, stop the program
	o  Calculate the direction of the cross
	o  Calculate the mean value of the two directions
	o  Set the motor speeds in order to head towards the mean direction

\b;The instruction \c;radar\n;
In order to detect a mine with the \c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n;, we recommend the following parameters:
\c;\s;	radar(Mine, 0, 180, 0, 5);\n;
With the opening angle of 180 degrees, mines that are behind the bot will not be found. Mines that are at more than 5 meters are also ignored.

In order to find a blue cross, simply write:
\c;\s;	radar(WayPoint);\n;
Blue crosses will be found everywhere.

In order to calculate a direction, use \c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n;.
In order to set the motor speeds, use \c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n;.
