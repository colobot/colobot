\b;Objective
Program the \l;grabber bot\u object\botgr; to change the \l;power cell\u object\power; of the \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj;. The winged shooter can then shoot the spiders.

\t;Procedure
1) Program the \l;grabber bot\u object\botgr;.
2) Execute the program with the arrow button \button 21;.
The \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj; is already programmed, it will do its job as soon as it has got a new power cell.

\t;Program
You will need the following instructions:
\c;
\s;grab();\n;
\n;Takes whatever there is in front of the bot.
\c;
\s;drop();\n;
\n;Drops whatever the bot is carrying in front.
\c;
\s;turn();\n;
\n;We have seen this instruction already in the previous exercise: it performs a rotation of a certain angle, given in degrees.

Let us see the beginning of the program:
o  pick up the empty power cell with \c;grab();\n;
o  turn left 90 degrees (quarter turn) with \c;turn(90)\n;
o  drop the empty cell with \c;drop();\n;
o  etc.

It is up to you now to write the rest of the program!

If you have got a problem, you can always look at the solution: select the \c;Solution\n; program, and click the braces button \button 22;.

\t;Remarks
Be careful to write the instructions precisely, respecting lower and upper case letters.

Always write one instruction per line, finishing each line with a semicolon.

In case your program does not do exactly what you wanted, you can put the bot back at the starting point with the button \button 59;. You can also start over again from the beginning (hit the key "Esc", the click "Restart"). The program you have written will not be lost.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times.
