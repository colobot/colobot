\b;From Mission Control
The previous expedition provided us with a piece of information about some \l;organic matter\u object\bullet;, which seems to be produced by the \l;ants\u object\ant;, and which opened startling new possibilities. It apparently allows the creation of a new type of mutant bot with enhanced performance through the use of insect parts.

Your mission is to experiment with the first practical application of this "green gold". Build a \l;legged grabber bot\u object\botgs;, load it on the spaceship and take off.

\b;Procedure
Take a sample of organic matter from a nest of giant ants. The analysis of it will be performed by an \l;autolab\u object\labo;, which will also perform the necessary research to allow a practical application.

In order to improve your defense capacity, we have transmitted a program to your \l;grabber bots\u object\botgr; that takes care of recharging the power cell of a \l;defense tower\u object\tower; (see \button 53; ).

\b;Note
The temperature has dropped significantly, it should therefore be possible to fly.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
