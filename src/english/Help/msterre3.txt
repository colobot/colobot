\b;Walkthrough
Before taking off, you need to bring the following aboard your spaceship:

1) \l;Black box\u object\bbox;.
2) \l;Wheeled\u object\botgr; and \l;tracked\u object\botgc; grabbers.
3) \l;Yourself\u object\human;.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the operations:
1) Power the \l;research center\u object\research; with one of the green \l;power cells\u object\power;.
2) Activate the \l;research center\u object\research; then click on the \button 64; <tracked bot research program> button.
3) Place a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan; inside the \l;bot factory\u object\factory;.
4) Step back out and activate the \l;bot factory\u object\factory;.
5) Click on the \button 138; <build a \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc;> button.
6) Power the \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc; with a brand new \l;power cell\u object\power;.
7) Radio-control the \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc; to the top of the mountain in the south-west.
8) Bring the \l;black box\u object\bbox; back aboard your \l;spaceship\u object\base;.
9) Radio-control both the \l;tracked\u object\botgc; and the \l;wheeled\u object\botgr; grabbers onto the platform.
10) Climb aboard the \l;spaceship\u object\base; yourself.
11) Take off!

In order to take off, select the \l;spaceship\u object\base;, provided that it is visible, by clicking on it. If it is not visible, you need to click one of the buttons in the upper left corner of your screen. The blue triangle \button 130; allows you to alternate between symbols for bots and symbols for buildings. Click once to shift to the <buildings> list. A \button 171; <spaceship> symbol will now appear. Click on the button to select it.

Once the spaceship is selected, click on the larger \button 28; <takeoff> button in the lower center of your screen. If the objects mentioned above as well as yourself are indeed standing on deck, takeoff will take place.

No object or bot should hinder the closing of the eight large panel doors.
