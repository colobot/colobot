This new weapon appears to be yet another practical application of what we've come to refer to as "green gold", the \l;organic matter\u object\bullet; produced by the insects. We've named this bot the \l;orga shooter\u object\botoj; or bot equipped with an orgaball cannon.

It will most certainly come in handy as you make your way back to your \l;spaceship\u object\base;.

\key;\key help;\norm; allows you to review these instructions at all times on your personal SatCom \button 63;.
