\b;Exercice
\b;Exercise
The \l;bot\u object\bottr; must pass over all the \l;blue crosses\u object\waypoint; on the ground. The way that must be covered is made of two squares. The first one measures 15 meters, the second 25 meters.

\image tproc1a 8 8;
\b;General principle
In order to solve this problem, the most efficient solution consists in creating a \l;function\u cbot\function; that instructs the bot to move on a square shape of a certain size. The main program becomes then very simple:\c;
\c;
\s;	extern void object::Function3( )
\s;	{
\s;		Square(15);
\s;		Square(25);
\s;	}
\n;
\b;Useful instructions
\c;\l;for\u cbot\for;\n; loop to repeat some instructions
\c;\l;move\u cbot\move;\n; to move the bot
\c;\l;turn\u cbot\turn;\n; to turn the bot
