\b;Exercise
Program the robot in such a way that it arrives on the finishing pad, after having passed by the three blue crosses.

\b;Procedure
1) Take the power cell and put it on the rear of the bot.
2) Walk around on reconnaissance to understand what the bot must do. 
3) Program the bot. To do so, you must select it, and then click on the braces button \button 22;; you will get into the program editor.
4) Once you finished writing the program, click "OK", and execute the program with the arrow key \button 21;.

\b;Program
The pads are at a distance of 20 meters from each other.
The instruction \c;move(20);\n; moves 20 meters forward. 
The instruction \c;turn(90);\n; turns left with an angle of 90 degrees. 
The instruction \c;turn(-90);\n; turns right with an angle of 90 degrees. 

The frame of the program consists in:
\c;
\s;	extern void object::MoveBot( )
\s;	{
\s;		\n;\\write the necessary instructions here ...\c;
\s;	}
\n;
For now, you must not change the frame of the program. Just insert the instructions you need to move the bot around between the braces \c;{ }\n;.

\b;Attention
Be very careful about upper case and lower case letters!
Every instruction must be terminated with a semicolon. 

\b;Helpful trick
When you write the program, you can watch the scene by clicking on the button <Reduce> \button 51;, and by moving the mouse to the edges of the window to turn the camera.
