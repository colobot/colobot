\b;Walkthrough
You'll find some useful items in a small valley northeast.
o  A \l;recycler\u object\botrecy; that will allow you to make your first \l;titanium cube\u object\titan;.
o  A \l;legged grabber\u object\botgs; that is very good at climbing steep slopes.
o  A nearly charged \l;nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;.

1) Power the \l;legged grabber\u object\botgs; with the \l;nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;, and use it to carry a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan; to the \l;spaceship\u object\base;. Choose the direct way over the mountains.

2) Use the titanium to build a \l;converter\u object\convert;. Execute the program \c;CollectTitanium3\n; on the \l;legged grabber\u object\botgs; and you will have plenty of titanium.

3) Stop the program, and use the grabber to collect some \l;uranium ore\u object\uranore; in a second small valley to the east. Again, do not take the way of the valley which is crawling with ants, but take the direct way over the mountains.

4) Build a \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj; and power it with a \l;nuclear power cell\u object\atomic;. If you take the pass south-east, you will arrive immediately at the ant nest. Kill all the ants, and bring back a ball of \l;organic matter\u object\bullet; to the \l;spaceship\u object\base;.

5) Build an \l;auto-lab\u object\labo;, drop the \l;organic matter\u object\bullet; on the platform and click the \button 110; button in order to develop the blueprints for the orgaShooter cannon.

6) Build a \l;legged orga shooter\u object\botos;, bring it aboard and take off.
