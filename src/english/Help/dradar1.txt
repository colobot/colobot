\b;Exercise
In this exercise, a "crazy bot" places many \l;blue crosses\u object\waypoint; on the ground. Just try to find them all.

\b;Useful instructions
\c;\l;radar\u cbot\radar;\n; to detect the blue crosses (category \c;\l;WayPoint\u object\waypoint;\n;)
\c;\l;direction\u cbot\direct;\n; to calculate a direction
\c;\l;if\u cbot\if;\n; to test a condition
\c;\l;motor\u cbot\motor;\n; to set the motor speeds

\t;Remark
Do not wait too long, because the crazy bot gets down to work immediately. Fortunately, as long as you are in the program editor, the game will pause.
