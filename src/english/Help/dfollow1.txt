\b;Exercise
You must follow the \l;target bot\u object\bottr; with the explosive device, but without touching it, otherwise it will blow up. Every time the target bot stops, you must be close to it (less than 10m). After you managed to stay close to the target bot at 10 successive stops, it will lead you to the finishing pad, and the exercise is over. At every stop, the target bot checks that you are there. If you are not there, you must start over again.

\b;General principle
Repeat forever:
o  Look for the target bot.
o  Calculate the distance to the bot.
o  if the distance to the target bot is less than 5m, move backward.
o  Otherwise, calculate the direction of the target bot, and move towards it.
