4) Build a \l;bot factory\u object\factory; and a \l;winged shooter\u object\botfj; to eliminate the \l;ants\u object\ant;.

5) Use a \l;winged grabber\u object\botgj; to bring back some \l;organic matter\u object\bullet; from the island in the middle of the lava lake.

6) Build an \l;autolab\u object\labo;, drop the \l;organic matter\u object\bullet; on the platform and click the button \button 109; in order to develop the blueprints for legged bots.
