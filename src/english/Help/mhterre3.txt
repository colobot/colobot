\b;From Mission Control
Your \l;spaceship\u object\base; is now standing on the launching pad, ready for takeoff.

The last drill left for \l;you\u object\human; to perform before embarking on your journey is to equip your spaceship with its \l;black box\u object\bbox;. The only way to reach the \l;black box\u object\bbox; is by a steep path that can only be climbed by a \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc; which you need to build.

Unfortunately your \l;bot factory\u object\factory; hasn't yet got the capacity to assemble this type of bot. You need to request your \l;research center\u object\research; to come up with a blueprint for this particular propeller.

\b;Procedure
1) Power the research center with one of the green \l;power cells\u object\power;.
2) Click on the <tracked bot research program> button \button 64;.
3) Drop a \l;titanium cube\u object\titan; in the center of the \l;bot factory\u object\factory; and build a \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc;.
4) Power and radio-control the \l;tracked grabber\u object\botgc; to the top of the southwest-oriented mountain.
5) Bring the black box back aboard your spaceship.
6) Don't forget to take the \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr; along. These bots may prove very useful in the future.
7) Climb aboard the \l;spaceship\u object\base;.
11) Select the \l;spaceship\u object\base; and take off \button 28;.


Please note: To work more efficiently, you can use the \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr;.
