\b;Programs dispatched by Houston
We have improved the recharge program. When it arrives at the \l;power station\u object\station;, the bot does not wait exactly 5 seconds, but only until the \l;power cell\u object\power; is fully charged. After the bot is back at the initial position, it displays a message on the screen.
\c;
\s;extern void object::Recharge2()
\s;{
\s;	\l;point\u cbot\type;  start;          // variable for initial pos.
\s;	\l;object\u cbot\type; item;           // info. about power station
\s;	
\s;	start = position;      // store initial position
\s;	
\s;	item = \l;radar\u cbot\radar;(\l;PowerStation\u cbot\category;); // look for station
\s;	\l;goto\u cbot\goto;(item.position);   // go to the power station
\s;	
\s;	\l;while\u cbot\while; ( \l;energyCell.energyLevel\u cbot\object; < 1 )
\s;	{
\s;		\l;wait\u cbot\wait;(1);           // wait until recharged
\s;	}
\s;	
\s;	\l;goto\u cbot\goto;(start);           // go back to initial pos.
\s;	\l;message\u cbot\message;("Recharge completed");
