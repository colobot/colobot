\b;Expressions
Expressions can include the following operators: 

\c;+\n;  addition
\c;-\n;  subtraction
\c;*\n;  multiplication
\c;/\n;  division
\c;%\n;  remainder of the division (only for the type \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;)

With the addition operator \c;+\n;, you can not only add numbers, you can also append \l;strings\u cbot\string;.
\c;
\s;	int    i = 12+3;      // returns 15
\s;	string s = "a"+"bc";  // returns "abc"
\s;	int    i = 2-5;       // returns -3
\s;	float  f = 3.01*10;   // returns 30.1
\s;	int    i = 5/3;       // returns 1
\s;	float  f = 5/3;       // returns 1.67
\s;	float  f = 5/0;       // returns an error
\s;	int    i = 13%5;      // returns 3
\s;	int    i = -8%3;      // returns -2
\n;
An expression can include constants or \l;variables\u cbot\var;. For example:

\s;\c;	12+dist\n;

Multiplications and divisions are performed before additions and subtractions. In order to be sure that the operations are performed in the right order, use brackets: 
\c;
\s;	12*a+b/c \n;is equivalent to\c; (12*a)+(b/c)
\s;	2.5*(dist+range)
\n;
In order to improve readability, you can put as many spaces as you want: 
\c;
\s;	12*a + b/c
\s;	2.5 * (dist+range)
\n;
Here is a list of mathematical functions: 

\c;sin(angle)    \n;sinus
\c;cos(angle)    \n;cosinus
\c;tan(angle)    \n;tangent
\c;asin(value)   \n;arc-sinus
\c;acos(value)   \n;arc-cosinus
\c;atan(value)   \n;arc-tangente
\c;sqrt(value)   \n;square root
\c;pow(x, y)     \n;x power y
\c;rand()        \n;random value ranging between 0 and 1

Angles are in degrees.

\t;Compound assignment operators (for specialists)
Besides the \c;=\n; operators for variable assignment there are several compound-assignment operators.

The compound-assignment operators combine the \c;=\n; assignment operator with another binary operator such as \c;+\n; or \c;-\n;. Compound-assignment operators perform the operation specified by the additional operator and then assign the result to the left operand. For example, a compound-assignment expression such as   

\c;\s;expression1 += expression2
  
is equivalent to

\c;\s;expression1 = expression1 + expression2

\c;+=\n;  addition
\c;-=\n;  subtraction
\c;*=\n;  multiplication
\c;/=\n;  division
\c;%=\n;  remainder of the division (only for the type \c;\l;int\u cbot\int;\n;)

\t;Prefix and posfix increment- and decrement operators (for specialists)
The operators \c;++\n; and \c;--\n; allow you to increment (++) or to decrement (--) a variable in very compact and efficient manner.

For example to increment the variable \c;a\n; you can write
\c;\s;	a++ ;
\n;instead of
\c;\s;	a = a + 1 ;
\n;
The value of the expression \c;a++\n; is the value of the variable \c;a\n; before the increment. If you use the prefix operator \c;++a\n; the value of the expression is the value of the variable \c;a\n; after the increment. The same holds for the \c;--\n; decrement operator.

Exemples:
\c;\s;	a = 2 ;
\s;	b = a++ ;
\s;	// now b contains 2 and a contains 3

\c;\s;	a = 2 ;
\s;	b = ++a ;
\s;	// now b contains 3 and a contains 3
\n;
