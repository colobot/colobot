\b;Instruction \c;writeln\n;
Write one line of text to an open file in the files/ folder. This is a method of the \c;\l;file\u cbot\file;\n; class. This is the reason why we always write \c;handle.writeln()\n;¦:
\c;
\s;	handle.writeln("abc");
\n;
The file must have been opened for writing (\c;"w"\n;) with the \c;\l;open\u cbot\open;\n; instruction. The line will automatically be terminated by the end of line characters 0x0D (CR) and 0x0A (LF).

Syntax¦:
\s;\c;handle.writeln ( string );\n;

Examples¦:
\c;
\s;	writeln("Line of text");

\s;	string s1 = "abc";
\s;	string s2 = "def";
\s;	writeln(s1 + " " + s2);
\n;
