\b;Instruction \c;public\n; (for specialists)
This instruction has two distinct purposes¦:

1) Make a function available to other bots.
2) Make a class member accessible from outside the class definition.

\b;Instruction \c;public\n; for functions
If you put \c;public\n; before a \l;function\u cbot\function; definition, you can make the function available to programs in other bots in the same mission.

For example in the first bot we would have¦:
\c;
\s;public void object::Segment(float dist, float angle)
\s;{
\s;	move(dist);
\s;	turn(angle);
\s;}
\n;
And in another bot we would have¦:
\c;
\s;extern void object::Square( )
\s;{
\s;	for ( int i=0 ; i<4 ; i++ )
\s;	{
\s;		Segment(10, 90);
\s;		fire(1);
\s;	}
\s;}
\n;
If you have declared a function \c;public\n;, you cannot define a function with the same name and arguments in another bot of the same mission.

If a bot containing a \c;public\n; function is destroyed, the other bots that make use of this function will be stopped with an error.

\b;Instruction \c;public\n; for classes
\l;Class\u cbot\class; members can be public (by default) or \l;privat\u cbot\private;. A member can be declared private by putting \c;private\n; before the member type. Private members are not accessible from outside the class definition.
\c;
\s;public class MyClass
\s;{
\s;	int    b;                // public by default
\s;	public int a;            // also public 
\s;	private point position;  // privat
\s;}
\s;void Test()
\s;{
\s;	MyClass item;
\s;	item.a = item.b = 12;      // ok
\s;	message( item.position );  // this is an error
\s;}
\n;
