\b;Instruction \c;for\n;
Syntax:
\s;\c;for ( before ; condition ; end )
\s;{
\s;	\n;Instructions ...\c;
\s;}
\n;
This instruction allows you to execute a certain number of times the instructions contained in the \l;block\u cbot\bloc;.

\t;\c;before\n;
This instruction is executed before the first loop instance.

\t;\c;condition\n;
This \l;condition\u cbot\cond; determines if another instance of the loop must be executed. It is tested before every instance of the loop. 

\t;\c;end\n;
This instruction is executed at the end of every instance of the loop. 

Example: count from 1 to 4
\c;\s;\c;for ( i = 0 ; i <= 4 ; i++ )
\s;{
\s;	message(i) ;
\s;}
\n;
The following example is strictly equivalent to a \c;for\n;-loop, but it uses the instruction \c;\l;while\u cbot\while;\n;:
\s;\c;before;
\s;while ( condition )
\s;{
\s;	\n;Instructions ...\c;
\s;	end;
\s;}
\n;
\t;Attention
Do not put a \l;semicolon\u cbot\term; at the end of the line \c;for ( )\n;.

The instructions \c;\l;break\u cbot\break;\n; and \c;\l;continue\u cbot\continue;\n; can be useful inside a block following the instruction \c;for \n;.
