\b;Instruction \c;distance\n;
With the instruction \c;distance( , )\n; you can calculate the distance between two positions.

\b;Basic use
If you write \c;position\n; alone, this gives you the position of the bot that executes the program. If you write the name of a variable followed by \c;.position\n;, this gives you the position of the object described in the variable.

Here is a program that moves forward, covering exactly the distance between the bot and the closest ant:
\c;
\s;	item = \l;radar\u cbot\radar;(AlienAnt);
\s;	\l;move\u cbot\move;(distance(position, item.position));
\n;
This is of course pure suicide. Better to stop 40 meters before, in order to be at shooting range:
\c;
\s;	item = radar(AlienAnt);
\s;	move(distance(position, item.position) - 40);
\n;
\b;For specialists
Syntax:
\s;\c;distance ( pos1, pos2 );\n;

Calculates the distance between two positions. 

\t;pos1, pos2: \c;\l;point\u cbot\point;\n;
Coordinates of the two positions. 

\t;Return value: \c;\l;float\u cbot\float;\n;
Distance between the two positions.
