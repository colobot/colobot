\b;Instruction \c;static\n; (for specialists)
\l;Class\u cbot\class; members declared with \c;static\n; are shared between all instances of the class.
\c;
\s;public class MyClass
\s;{
\s;	static int nb = 1;
\s;	static string [ ] list = null;
\s;}
\s;void Test ()
\s;{
\s;	MyClasse item1();
\s;	MyClasse item2();
\s;	item1.nb = 3;
\s;	item1.list[item1.nb] = "Hello";
\s;	message( item2.list[item2.nb] ); // display "Hello"
\s;}
\n;
\c;Static\n; members can be declared \c;\l;private\u cbot\private;\n; so they will be only acessible from within class members (including constructors and destructors).
