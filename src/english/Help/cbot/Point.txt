\b;Type \c;point\n;
Variables of this type contain the coordinates of a point in space. This type is made of three values that represent the \c;x\n;, \c;y\n; and \c;z\n; coordinates.
\c;x\n; and \c;y\n; correspond to the place on the ground. The positive \c;x\n; axis faces towards east, the positive \c;y\n; axis faces towards north. 
The \c;z\n; value corresponds to the altitude above sea level. 

If you want to declare a variable of type point, you can write: 
\c;
\s;	point a (10, 20, 30);
\n;
You can also set the variable taking one value after another:
\c;
\s;	point b;
\s;	b.x = 10;
\s;	b.y = 20;
\s;	b.z = 30;
\n;
With these examples, the following \l;condition\u cbot\cond; is true:
\c;
\s;	if ( a == b )
\s;	{
\s;	}
\n; 
The following declaration :
\c;
\s;	point c (4, 7);
\n;
Is equivalent to :
\c;
\s;	point c;
\s;	c.x = 4;
\s;	c.y = 7;
\s;	c.z = 0;
\n;
