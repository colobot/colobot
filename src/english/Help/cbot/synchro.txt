\b;Instruction \c;synchronized\n; (for specialists)
A \l;class\u cbot\class; method can be declared \c;synchronized\n;. This is to make sure that the method is never being executed by more than one bot at the same time.

The following example illustrates the problem:
\c;
\s;class blocking
\s;{
\s;	static int nb = 33;
\s;	synchronized int inc( )
\s;	{
\s;		int val = nb;
\s;		wait ( 2 );  // wait 2 sec.
\s;		nb = nb + 1;
\s;		return val;
\s;	}
\s;}
\n;
What happens if two bots execute the \c;inc\n; method at the same time¦?
Both of them will execute \c;val=nb\n; and wait 2 seconds so both of them will have \c;val=33\n;. With \c;synchronized\n; the first bot starts execution with \c;val=33\n; and then waits 2 seconds and returns. Only once the first bot has returned from the \c;inc\n; method, the second bot will be allowed to enter the \c;inc\n; method and therefore the second bot will always have \c;val=34\n;.

You can have more than one synchronized method in your \l;class\u cbot\class; in order to prevent simultaneous execution across more than one method. In other words: as long as a bot's program is inside a synchronized method, no other bot can enter any synchronized method of the same class.
