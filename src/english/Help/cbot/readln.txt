\b;Instruction \c;readln\n;
Read one line from an open file in the files/ folder. This is a method of the \c;\l;file\u cbot\file;\n; class. This is the reason why we always write \c;handle.readln()\n;¦:
\c;
\s;	s = handle.readln();
\n;
The file must have been opened for reading (\c;"r"\n;) with the \c;\l;open\u cbot\open;\n; instruction. \c;readln\n; returns the string containing the whole line but without the end of line characters 0x0D (CR) and 0x0A (LF).

Syntax¦:
\s;\c;string = handle.readln ( );\n;

Example¦:
\c;
\s;	string s;
\s;	s = handle.readln();
\s;	if ( s == "abc" )
\s;	...
\n;
