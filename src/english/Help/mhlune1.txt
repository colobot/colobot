Collect 4 chunks of \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore; and bring them back aboard your \l;spaceship\u object\base;. Build the equipment necessary for this task (\l;flying bots\u object\botgj;).

Before you venture any further, you should always take a look at the satellite report \button 186;.

We have transmitted to your \l;spaceship\u object\base; a program that might help you in this task; please refer to the corresponding page of your SatCom with the button \button 53;.

\b;Procedure
1) A new \l;research program\u object\research; is required for winged bots to be added to the list of bots that can be produced by the factory. This research program will also make the propulsion reactor in your personal survival kit operational.

2) Produce a \l;winged grabber\u object\botgj; and collect the 4 chunks of \l;titanium ore\u object\titanore;.

3) Take the \l;winged grabber\u object\botgj; and the \l;wheeled grabber\u object\botgr; along with you and take off. 

Be careful that your winged bot does not run out of power when you are far from base. If necessary, replace the \l;power cell\u object\power; before leaving the spaceship. You can either do this manually or you can execute the enclosed program provided by Houston \button 53;.

In order not to lose your way among the numerous craters on the Moon's surface, use the mini map on the lower right-hand corner of your screen.
