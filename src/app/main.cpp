Doxygen documentation of Colobot project

\section Intro Introduction

The source code released by Epitec was sparsely documented. This documentation, written from scratch,
will aim to describe the various components of the code.

Currently, the only documented classes are the ones written from scratch or the old ones rewritten
to match the new code.
In time, the documentation will be extended to cover every major part of the code.

\section Structure Code structure

The source code was split from the original all-in-one directory to subdirectories,
each containing one major part of the project.
The current layout is the following:
 - src/CBot - separate library with CBot language
 - src/app - class CApplication and everything concerned with SDL plus other system-dependent
   code such as displaying a message box, finding files, etc.
 - src/common - shared structs, enums, defines, etc.; should not have any external dependencies
 - src/graphics/core - abstract interface of graphics device (abstract CDevice class)
   (split from old src/graphics/common)
 - src/graphics/engine - main graphics engine based on abstract graphics device; is composed
   of CEngine class and associated classes implementing the 3D engine (split from old src/graphics/common)
 - src/graphics/opengl - concrete implementation of CDevice class in OpenGL: CGLDevice
 - src/graphics/d3d - in (far) future - perhaps a newer implementation in DirectX (9? 10?)
 - src/math - mathematical structures and functions
 - src/object - non-graphical game engine, that is robots, buildings, etc.
 - src/ui - 2D user interface (menu, buttons, check boxes, etc.)
 - src/sound - sound and music engine written using fmod library
 - src/physics - physics engine
 - src/script - link with the CBot library
 - src/metafile - separate program for packing data files to .dat format
