/**
 * \class CApplication
 * \brief Main application
 *
 * This class is responsible for main application execution, including creating
 * and handling main application window, receiving events, etc.
 *
 * It is a singleton class with only one instance that can be created.
 *
 * \section Creation Creation of other main objects
 *
 * The class creates the only instance of CInstanceManager, CEventQueue, CEngine,
 * CRobotMain and CSound classes.
 *
 * \section Window Window management
 *
 * The class is responsible for creating app window, setting and changing the video mode,
 * joystick management, grabbing input and changing the system mouse cursor
 * position and visibility.
 * ("System mouse cursor" means the cursor displayed by the OS in constrast to the cursor
 * displayed by CEngine).
 *
 * \section Events Events
 *
 * Events are taken from SDL event queue, translated to common events from src/common.h
 * and pushed to global event queue CEventQueue.
 *
 * Joystick events are generated somewhat differently, by running a separate timer,
 * polling the device for changes and synthesising events on change. It avoids flooding
 * the event queue with too many joystick events and the granularity of the timer can be
 * adjusted.
 *
 * The events are passed to ProcessEvent() of classes in this order: CApplication, CEngine
 * and CRobotMain. CApplication and CEngine's ProcessEvent() functions return bool, which
 * means whether to pass the event on, or stop the chain. This is to enable handling some
 * events which are internal to CApplication or CEngine.
 *
 * \section Portability Portability
 *
 * Currently, the class only handles OpenGL devices. SDL can be used with DirectX, but
 * for that to work, video initialization and video setting must be done differently.
 *
