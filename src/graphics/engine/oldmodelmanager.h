/**
 * \class COldModelManager
 * \brief Manager for static models
 *
 * The manager allows for loading models as static objects and adding
 * new instances of models to the engine.
 *
 * The models are loaded from stanard application model directory and
 * they are identified by unique file names.
 *
 * The models are loaded by creating (if it doesn't exist yet)
 * a base engine object from the model geometry. This base object
 * is then shared among all instances of this model with the instances
 * being engine objects linked to the shared base object.
 *
 * There is also a possibility of creating a copy of model so it has
 * its own and unique base engine object. This is especially useful
 * for models where the geometry must be altered.
