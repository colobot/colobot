Welcome to Colobot project repository

This repository contains the source files of Colobot game released on open source license (GNU GPLv3) by the producer Epsitec CH. The sources were released and the rights granted to a group of Polish Colobot fans centered around the site http://colobot.cba.pl/ . This repository contains only the source code of the game. The necessary data files will soon be available as a separate download. For now, though, you can download the original download package released by Epsitec (the link is on http://colobot.cba.pl/ site).

For more information on the project, see the wiki pages.

Status

Our first goal has been reached now: the project has been successfully ported to CMake build system and MinGW compiler from the original MSVC6 project.

Now our goal is to port the game to OpenGL and SDL, thus making it multiplatform. Further goals include adding new features to the game, though that will be decided later on.

Compiling and running the game

For these instructions see HOWTO.txt file.
